## Development

### Before you start

1. Run `make up` (need docker/docker-compose installed)

2. On your docker-compose logs, you should be able to see when the `keycloak` container finishes initializing (it says something like "admin panel listening at http://localhost:8080"). Once it is ready, go to said admin panel, login with `admin`/`password`.

3. Go to the "Blink Realm" (see top left corner) and create a dummy user to login as, following the instructions here: https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_create-new-user

And once you're done with development, you can run `make down` to shut down and cleanup all the containers that spun up.

NOTE: that you actually _do not_ have to run the cleanup every time you `npm start`; you can shut down the `npm start` server/frontend combo and re-boot it as many times as you'd like without needing to `make up` every time - the migrations and the build process will run fine even with existing data(!)

### Starting Blink

Run `npm start` to boot up backend express server and frontend react "live-loader"

Congrats, now the frontend should be available at http://localhost:4000/app and the backend at http://localhost:3000!

One thing of note: when you log in with Keycloak's SSO, you will be redirected to http://localhost:3000/app on development mode; just change that to http://localhost:4000/app and hit enter. I am NOT changing this.

## Run tests

```sh
npm test
```
