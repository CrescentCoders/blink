## How do I configure shit?

There are two ways to configure environment variables. One is by simply exposing these variables to the environment (duh), but take care to make sure that these variables won't simply just disappear on reboot, and to actually expose them to the container if you're using Docker (you can use -e flags to pass environment variables to the underlying container).

The other way is by configuring `.env` files. These env files are loaded in the following order (meaning, if you have `VAR=1` in `.env.production.local` and `VAR=2` in `.env`, the application will see `VAR=1`):

```
.env.production.local
.env.production
.env.local
.env
```

Note that non-local environment files are checked in through git, so I suggest creating `.env.production.local` and using that for configuring production workloads instead of just overriding whatever is in `.env`. And again, if you're using Docker, make sure to actually volume map these files to the _inside_ of the containers (the directory to mount it on is `/home/node`).

## App-specific configuration

For the most part, the comments on `.env` files should be sufficient, but I'll explain some of the more confusing ones here just in case.

### HOMEPAGE, BASE_URL, and all the other OIDC shit

See the bit about the domain name and identity provider in the [Prereqs page](/Installation/2.1%20Prerequisites)

### Sessions

You can configure `SESSION_DURATION`/`SESSION_SECRET`. The session does not "roll over" once it expires. The session is stored in Redis, using cookie-based authentication.

Please please _please_ make sure to change `SESSION_SECRET` to something ACTUALLY long and private. If you're deploying via Heroku, it should already be automatically done for you.

### Rate limiting

To be honest, the rate limiting is only here because github bitched at me for it being a "security risk" - despite the fact that this server is meant to be accessed only by internal users and the CDN (which, again, should cache basically every single call after the first one).

For sake of easier configuration, I re-use the same `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` and just have a different rate "limit" for people who are logged in vs. logged out (`RATE_LIMIT_MAX_LOGGED_IN` which tracks number of hits per person logged in, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_LOGGED_OUT` which tracks number of unauthenticated hits in general). The defaults should suffice, but be care to not lower them too much - the frontend makes a bunch of API calls "in the background", even if you might be loading just one page/logging in.

### Timeouts

We scrape our own links here at $CORP to fill in the blanks about any given link. We have a customizable timeout via `LINK_TIMEOUT`. Increase this if the link scraping is not working.

### Cache

There are two ways to go about configuring `CACHE_MAX_AGE`:

1. Keep it relatively short (e.g. a few hours) so that the CDN would revalidate with the Blink server relatively often.
2. Keep it basically "infinite" (the default) so that the CDN would hold onto the cache hopefully forever.

Option 1 is better if you plan on busting the cache semi-regularly and don't want to rely on some integration to bust the cache _for_ you (at the cost of higher server load and serving slightly stale links, should you change/delete a link).

Option 2 is better if you plan on either never "deleting" links from Blink or busting the cache manually or via an integration (which will be coming post-v1 launch).
