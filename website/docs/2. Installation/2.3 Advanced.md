## Deploying to Your Own Server

A few commonalities to keep in mind no matter how you're running the Blink server (most of these are standard 12-factor app practices):

- The process pipes logs to STDOUT/STDERR in json format, so your environment (whether it be Kubernetes or just a simple pipe to files) should handle the logs coming off of STDOUT/STDERR.
- Database migrations need to run _before_ running the server in order to set up the DB. Furthermore, every time you update the app, you should run `npm run migrate` in order to keep the database's structure up-to-date.
- The server is only exported as a singular process - no process wrappers, or anything of the sort. That means that your environment must support running the app in a resilient way, whether it is running the Docker container to restart on failure, running the container as part of a greater orchestration system, or running the process using `pm2`/`systemd`.
- The server is a stateless process; therefore, you may kill it however much you'd like (especially given that it is expected for the CDN to cache basically all requests)
- This also means there's no trouble clustering/running multiple instances of the server (though it _really_ shouldn't be necessary): just spin multiple instances up and load balance across the instances.
- You can specify the port that the server runs on using the $PORT environment variable. Otherwise, it will run on port 3000 by default.
- The server itself does not speak HTTPS; rather, it exposes its API and UI via http, and _expects_ a reverse proxy to terminate the SSL and forward the entire Blink domain/subdomain to the process.

Please see the [Configuration page](/Server%20Administration/3.1%20Configuration) to learn _how_ to configure these variables - below I'm just passing them manually for simplicity's sake!

### Docker

Blink is provided as a Docker container! Just pull the image, connect it to your SSO/CDN as described in the previous sections, and connect it to your postgres/redis instances:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/janejeon/blink:latest
docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... \
    ghcr.io/janejeon/blink:latest npm run migrate
docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... -e REDIS_URL=... \
    -e HOMEPAGE=... -e BASE_URL=... \
    -e OIDC_CLIENT_ID=... -e OIDC_ISSUER_BASE_URL=... \
    ghcr.io/janejeon/blink:latest
```

### Bare Metal

Clone the repo on your server, then like above, configure the `.env` (or `.env.production` or `.env.production.local`) file.

Then, it's just a couple of steps to run:

```sh
export NODE_ENV=production
npm i -P && \
    npm run build && \
    npm run migrate && \
    node bin/www
```

Note that we only support node LTS versions, so if you're expecting difficulties, try using the LTS build.
