## Deploy

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

After you're done deploying, visit the dashboard at $YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com/app

This is a basic 12-factor node app, so you could also just run it on your server directly with `pm2`. If you're hosting on your own environment, take care to configure the Redis and Postgres URLs correctly.

Once you sign in with your SSO, make sure to give yourself admin privileges by running `npm run promote-user`. Note that this only works if you have signed up with SSO already and you're the only user; if someone else already signed up, find your user id and run `npm run promote-user $yourUserId`.

### Updating Heroku source for the server

In your clone of this repo, run:

    heroku git:remote -a $YOURAPPNAME
    git fetch origin vX.Y.Z
    git push heroku master
